## How it's made this blog - 25/01/2021

In 2021 I decided to publish a blog and so selecting a blogging platform became the problem of the day.

I was searching for a reasonable platform with following requirements:

- does not look in with a vendor
- low cost
- no maintenance required (almost)

After spending few hours checking for hosting platform like Wix, Squarespace and various Wordpress hosting services, I realized none of this will satisfy my requirements. The first ones will lock me into a vendor, the second is way costly for something I consider a commodity. I considered running a Wordpress on a minimal VPS on my own, but this still will require finding the best cost/performance VPS solution, install Wordpress and Databases, deal with plugins, updates, backups, etc.This pushed me to consider a more simple solution and the most simple solution is to run on static pages.

A few googling around and I found something called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a simple static site generator that uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) (that I already know) and a template system for generating a static website. Jekyll is open source platform that does not lock me with a vendor and I can virtually deploy my static website on any cheap static hosting service.

Jekyll is used in hundred sites like [italia.it](developers.italia.it), other big tech company and is also at the core of GitHub Pages so I’m sure the developer community will support it and it will not die soon. GitHub also offer free hosting of Jekyll websites with custom domain too.

Knowing this, the blog was only a few clicks away and now is running on GitHub for free.
